Make first node in list head node
For all nodes {n0, n1, ..., nN}
    For any node n0 and n1, while (n0.value > n1.value):
        Make n1 the left node n0
    When n1.value > n0.value:
        Make n1 the right node of the parent of n0
    Then for the next node, recursively go up the tree to insert the right branch (unfinished description)
